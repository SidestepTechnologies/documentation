## Going further. Merchandise for tours and shows

### Getting current tours

A list of current tours is available at `artists/:artist_id/tours`. Sidestep API uses tours to group shows within one or multiple countries having the same currency. For example, an artist's tour in US & Canada is represented as two tour objects: one for US shows and one for Canada shows. Each tour has it's own set of products.

Tours can be fetched with:

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url https://production.sidestepapp.com/api/artists/1/tours \
  --header 'x-sidestep-app-token: your-sidestep-app-token'
```

```json
{
  "tours": [
    {
      "id": 48,
      "created_at": "2016-02-03T22:49:56.779Z",
      "updated_at": "2016-02-03T22:49:56.779Z",
      "title": "Wintour is Coming (Spring 2016)",
      "state": "active",
      "currency": "usd",
      "artist_id": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Show Attributes:

Attribute     | Description
:------------ | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
id            |
show_datetime | ISO 8601 formatted date & time in UTC. Use `Venue.time_zone_name` to display in local time
currency      | ISO 3-letter currency code. Use it to format product prices within this tour.
venue_id      | ID of a venue. Venues are always included into the response under the root key `venues`

Venue attributes:

Attribute      | Description

city           |
region         | An abbreviation of a state. Only for `United States`
country        | A name of a country
time_zone_name | IATA time zone name. Use it to display `Show.show_datetime` in a local timezone.

#### Important thing to know about date√ó of shows

Date and time of shows are usually displayed in the local timezone of the venue. It's very similar to how flight arrival & departure times are always displayed in local times.

Sidestep API always returns IATA time zone name in `time_zone_name` attribute of a venue object. An example value of this attribute is `America/New_York`. IATA timezone name can be used to convert a value in `show_datetime` to a local time.
